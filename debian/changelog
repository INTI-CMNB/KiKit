kikit (1.2.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Bugfixes:
    - not all layers were considered when using all in the layer selector
    - user layers were added to the layer selector
    - V-cut copper clearance wasn't applied to internal layers
    - GUI sections are now properly shown/hidden after importing JSON
      configuration
  * New features:
    - you can now specify fillet radius for tabs. Therefore, you can achieve a
      rounded board-tab interface without milling simulation.
    - panel can now be positioned via a percentage of the page width. Therefore,
      you can, e.g., specify 50% to place the panel in the middle of the page.
    - with regards to the previous change, the separate command now behaves in
      agreement with its docstring, i.e., it places the separated board in the
      middle of the page.
